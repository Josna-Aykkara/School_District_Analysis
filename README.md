# School_District_Analysis


## Overview of the Project

The project is to analysis the student funding and student test scores for reading and math based on the data provided. The analysed the data and was able to view the trends in the school performance based on the different grades and school type along with the budget information for the schools. The data set consist of 15 different schools and consisting of 14,831 students in total.

## Analysis and Results

•	Based on the summary statistics, the average reading score across the different types of school for students is 72.35 which is higher than the average math score that is 64.67. It also throws light on the fact that even the minimum score of 3.70 for math score is much lower than the minimum score of 10.50 for reading score. So, more steps should be directed to increase the scores for math by providing additional lessons or other assistance based on the need of the respective schools. 
IC 1

•	The comprehensive analysis of the students of grade 9 from the different schools scored higher marks in the reading aspect compared to the math score. The average school budget set aside for grade 9 was higher than the average overall budget
PIC 2

•	The charter schools received a lower budget compared to the public schools. The effective utilization of budget was achieved by the charter type schools centred on the student performance score for maths and reading. A suggestion can be made to public schools to implement certain measures followed by charter schools to get the current results.
PIC 3

•	A bulk number of students around 2038 were enrolled at Montgomery High school   compared to the lower enrollment of 171 at Chang High school. It would valuable if we could identify the reason for the lower number of enrollment at the Chang high school and look for steps to increase the enrollment rate. It would benefit the school board to identify if it would be beneficial to divert the funds to a school which are lacking funds based on additional information. 
PIC 4

•	The in-depth analysis of math score on the wider scale, educates us that the charter schools scored a higher average math score compared to public schools over the various grades. The public school average math score was lower than the overall average math score of 664.7 for all the schools.
